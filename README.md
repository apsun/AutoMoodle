# AutoMoodle

A userscript that adds a much-needed "copy attempt" button to the UIUC Moodle
system (learn.illinois.edu). No more will you have to manually copy all
your answers from the previous attempt just to change one answer!

## Usage

Simply click the "Copy attempt" link, located under the "review" column. Wait
for the page to reload, then click on "Continue the last attempt".
