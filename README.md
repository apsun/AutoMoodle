# AutoMoodle

A userscript that adds a much-needed "copy attempt" button to the UIUC Moodle
system (learn.illinois.edu). No more will you have to manually copy all
your answers from the previous attempt just to change one answer!

## Usage

[Install the userscript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apsun/AutoMoodle/master/automoodle.user.js),
and you're all set! The next time you're on the homework page, you'll see a
new "Copy attempt" link under the under the "review" column. Click on it, and
wait for the page to reload (it may take a few seconds). Your answers have now
been copied to your current attempt (if you don't have a current attempt, one
will automatically be created).
